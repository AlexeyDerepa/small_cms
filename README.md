to start this project you have to do next actions
1) Run the CLI in the folder where you put this project
2) Type in the CLI : npm install 
3) Type in the CLI : npm run start 

I saw at the mockup that you specified path to page cms, but this application is very simple, we have only one page. So as a rezult I did not use routing, if you need I can implement react-routing.
